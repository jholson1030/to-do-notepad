This will be an interactive to-do/notepad application built with HTML/CSS/JS. It will have the ability to
add, edit, and remove tasks/notes using DOM manipulation. Eventually I would like to turn this into
a fully-functional day/week/month planner.

Main Objectives:
    - Create a container element that will hold all tasks/notes [x]
    - Have an area at the bottom of the page to input text and have that text appear in the note container [x]
    - Have a button next to each note/task that will delete them from the container
    - Have a button next to each note/task to edit them
    - Make the option to set a timer for certain tasks that are time sensitive
